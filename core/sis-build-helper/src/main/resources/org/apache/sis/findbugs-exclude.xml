    "Class is Serializable, but does not define serialVersionUID":
    Disabled because overlaps with the javac warning. Rely on javac instead
    since it can be controlled by the standard @SuppressWarnings annotation.
  -->
  <Match>
    <Bug pattern="SE_NO_SERIALVERSIONID"/>
  </Match>

  <!--
    "Switch statement found where one case falls through to the next case":
    Disabled because overlaps with the javac warning. Rely on javac instead
    since it can be controlled by the standard @SuppressWarnings annotation.

  <Match>
    <Bug pattern="SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH"/>
  </Match>

  <!--
    "Switch statement found where default case is missing":
    Not a bug. When a default statement was really necessary, we usually
    get other compilation errors like unassigned final local variables.
